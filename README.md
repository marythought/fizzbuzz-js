Assignment:

Write a stand-alone javascript program that iterates over the numbers 1 to 1000. For each number, your program should print each number, but substitute "fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "buzz" if it is divisible by 5, and therefore "fizzbuzz" if it is divisible by both.

Approach:

I first completed this as a console.log for each iteration through the loop, and then switched to a string result, which enabled me to run tests on the function's result to ensure the expected content is there. I learned how to load a javascript file in Node using the source below.
